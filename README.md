# Cardboard-STL-Viewer
A quick hack for viewing an STL file with Google Cardboard.

This uses Three JS to display an STL file:

It also uses Jaanga's Cardboard demo:

You will need Google Cardboard to view it in 3D:

On desktop, the model spins freely. Currently on mobile, you will see a white screen until you orient your phone to find the model (it may be behind you).
